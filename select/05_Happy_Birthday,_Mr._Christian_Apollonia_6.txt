Late in my early teenage, I was considered fast
While some of the girls were failing, I passed in every class
Our principal's name was Christian and I played upon his fears
In exchange for my diploma, I loved him through the years

Happy birthday, Mr. Christian
What are we gonna do?
You want a teenage past-time, I want a love that's true
A man in your position, you oughta be ashamed
Happy birthday, Mr. Christian
Why can't you live up to your name?

It was only the first semester, but my body developed quick
Compared to the size of my chest then, all the other girls looked sick
Mr. Christian stared at me always, desire turned to pain
I suggested we go to his office and that's when the lunch bell rang

Happy birthday, Mr. Christian
What are we gonna do?
You want a teenage past-time, I want a love that's true
A man in your position, you oughta be ashamed
Happy birthday, Mr. Christian
Why can't you live up to your name?

Oh, Mr. Christian, you're a bad boy
Why that's not a pencil, shame
Oh, Mr. Christian, you're a bad boy
Why can't you live up to your name?

We had our love down to an art form
Each act was like scenes from a play
With every lesson I gave him
Mr. Christian gave me an A
I graduated with honors
A riddle to everyone
Everyone except Christian
Mr. Christian and I, and our son

Happy birthday, Mr. Christian
What are we gonna do?
You want a teenage past-time, I want a love that's true
A man in your position, you oughta be ashamed
Happy birthday, Mr. Christian
Why can't you live up to your name?

Happy birthday, Mr. Christian
What are we gonna do?
You want a teenage past-time, I want a love that's true (No tengo tiempo para jugar)
(Necesito un hombre verdadero, no metido)
A man in your position, you oughta be ashamed (Tú sí que no te enteras, chaval, OK?)
(Qué hacemos? Habla fuerte que no te oigo!)
Happy birthday, Mr. Christian (Christian, Christian!)
Woah-woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah

Oh, Mr. Christian, you're a bad boy

Christian
Give me some horns, uh!
I like it!

Christian, Christian, Christian!

Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, Mr. Christian, happy birthday to you

Happy birthday, Mr. Christian
