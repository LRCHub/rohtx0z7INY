Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday Mr. President
Happy birthday to you

Thanks, Mr. President
For all the things you've done
The battles that you've won
The way you deal with U.S. Steel
And our problems by the ton
We thank you so much

Everybody, happy birthday

Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States!

Thank you!
I can now retire from politics after having had the birthday sang to me
In such a sweet way
