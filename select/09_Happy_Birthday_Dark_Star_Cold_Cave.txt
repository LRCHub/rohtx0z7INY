Happy Birthday Dark Star
Hope all your dreams come true
Oh I've never seen anything as beautiful as you
In the heart of every galaxy
Rains diamonds from your eyes
Come in to the light of the jealous moon
And kiss me goodnight

Happy Birthday Dark Star
Oh I hope your wish came true
I've never seen anything shine as bright as you
In the center of the universe
The candy coated lies
Eclipse the sun on everyone
And kiss me goodbye

Something in the atmosphere explodes
Kingdom comes as no surprise
Heaven knows

Fill the void inside I can't explain
The horizon grips the fire from within

Don't fade
We never needed you more
Do not faint
You're burning in the afterglow

Happy Birthday Dark Star
Hope all your dreams come true
Oh I've never seen anything as beautiful as you
